### What is Git?

* Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers to manage and track changes to their codebase. It allows multiple developers to work on a single project simultaneously and facilitates collaboration by providing features such as branching,mrging and conflict resolution.

### What is version control system?

* A system that keeps reords of our changes.

* Allows for collaborative developement.

* Allows us to know who made what changes and when.

* Allows us to revert any changes in local repo.

### What is repository in git?

* A repository is often referred to as a 'repo' in a central location where git stores all files and directories of a project, along with their complete history.

* It contains the entire version history of a project including all commits and branches.

### What is distributed VCS ?

* A distributed VCS is a type of a VCS where each user maintains a complete copy of the project, including the entire history of changes.

* In distributed VCS every users local repo is fully functional and independent copy of the project.

### What are the VCS available in market?

* Github

* Bitbucket

* GItlab

* Subversion

* Mercurial

### What is the difference b/w git & github?

* "GIT": A distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate by managing the history of file changes.

* "Github": A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools, issue tracking, CI/CD workflows, and more.

### What is the purpose of 'git clone' command?

* The purpose of git clone is used to create a local copy of remote git repository. It downloads the entire repository including all of its files, commit history and branches to our local repository.

### What is the difference b/w 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?

* "git pull" : is a combination of 2 commands namely, git fetch and git merge. It fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them with local branch.

* "git fetch" : it only downloads the latest changes from the remote repository, but it doesnot automatically merge them. It updates the remote tracking branches, allowing us to review the changes before merging.

### How do you resolve merge conflicts?

* When a merge conflict occurs, it means that git is unable to automatically merge the changes from different branches.

* To resolve the conflict, we need to mannually edit the following conflicting files to choose the desired changes.

* After resolving the conflicts we can use 'git add' command to stage the changes, followed by 'git commit' to complete the merge.

### What is the difference b/w a branch and tag in git?

* In git, a branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a specific commit. It allows for parallel deployment and isolate changes from each other. Developers can create new branches to work on new features or bug fixes.

* A tag is a reference to a specific commit that is used to mark a significant point in the projects history, such as a release or a version.

### Why we need branches?

* Branches are essential and allows developers to work effectively for organizing and managing the development process, enabling collaboration and maintain code quality.

* Branches helps us to avoid problematic code got deployed onto the system
